The internship management system is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the internship process for both interns and mentors. Interns create their profiles by signing up with an email address or LinkedIn, then fill in details such as personal information, work experience, mentor contact details, educational background, and upload necessary documents like their internship certificate and CV. Once their profile is complete, they are redirected to the home page.

The home page features navigation to four main sections: *Intern Profile, **Mentor Profile, **Dashboard, and **Real-Time Communication. The **Dashboard* allows mentors to assign assignments with a 15-day deadline, monitor submission progress with a real-time countdown, and grade assignments. Mentors can also verify intern profiles. The *Chatbox* enables real-time communication between interns and mentors for questions or guidance. Additionally, a *Zoom meeting* feature allows for interactive, face-to-face mentoring sessions. This platform ensures effective collaboration, task management, and communication throughout the internship.
